## Why the screenshots and some code are censored?
"Sweb service - installed base" is a platform developed for the skidata employees only. It contains secret information which I am not allowed to share public in internet. I had to make changes in code, so the whole script is not working because links and credentials are deleted, but I am sharing the code and my main idea of developed platform.
